I have worked as a civil engineer on telecommunications infrastructure projects for over 10 years. I am currently in a career transition completing Masters of IT (Data Analytics) at Swinburne University of Technology. Also currently looking for a role in data science or data engineering. Using github to display some of my university projects and other personal projects.
